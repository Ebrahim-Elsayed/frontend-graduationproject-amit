                    <p>
                        <span>COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</span>
                        It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei,
                        China.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and
                        breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
                        respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

                    <p>
                        Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                        mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact
                        with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

                    aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually
                    mild and begin gradually. Also the symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.</p>

                                People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living
                                in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the
                                disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or
                                other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.Stigma is discrimination against
                                an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack
                                of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease
                                and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.Stigma hurts everyone by creating
                                more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the
                                problem.

                                person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a
                                continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are
                                less so.

                                prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering
                                specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and
                                results of laboratory testing for that patient.

                                It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some
                                other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but
                                that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other
                                months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when
                                weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility,

                                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
                                respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19
                                associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash
                                your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the
                                day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the
                                bathroom.

                                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that
                                has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but
                                this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

                                In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is
                                likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a
                                period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                    COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other
                                    people in the office or waiting room from getting infected. Ask the healthcare
                                    provider to call the local or state health department for additional guidance. If
                                    the patient has a medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch
                                    personnel that the patient has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19.

                                If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others; when you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.

                                Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

                                The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information.

                                The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients
                                may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These
                                symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t
                                develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the
                                disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets
                                COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
                                those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                                diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and
                                difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                                This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your child’s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friend’s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.

                                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                                In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation
                                can cause skin irritation.

                                Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have
                                a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.
                                This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become
                                sick and develop a fever.

                            Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?

                                No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza
                                type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying
                                to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against
                                respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.
